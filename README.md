# Succinylation-with-biophysico-and-deep-learning
Lysine succinylation is a kind of post-translational modification (PTM) which plays a crucial role in regulating the cellular processes. Aberrant succinylation may cause inflammation, cancers, metabolism diseases and nervous system diseases. The wet lab experimental methods to detect PTM sites are time-consuming and costly. Hence, it is of great importance to build computational predictor which can quickly predict succinylation sites with high efficacy.

This repository is part of my research work where I tried to incorporate biochemical and physicochemical properties of amino acids with deep learning to build a robust succinylation site predictor.
